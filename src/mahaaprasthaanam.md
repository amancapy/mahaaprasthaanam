# The Great Journey

Another world,\
another world,\
another world beckons!\
Go forth,\
go shoving!\
Let us go, let us go higher, higher!

Stomping step,\
singing the word,\
roaring our inner hearts out--\
come, let us go,\
do you not hear\
the other world's watefall?

The whole path long, heart and blood,\
giving them tribute, let us go forth!\
Walking paths,\
agitating towns,\
cross all forts!\
Rivers and streams,\
forests, mountains,\
are deserts to us an obstacle?

Go forth!\
Go shoving!\
Let us go, let us go higher, higher!\
Of rotten bone,\
of youth misled,\
ye slouches, perish!\
Of boiling blood,\
with forces filling,\
ye soldiers! Come along!\
Say "harom! harom hara!\
hara! hara! hara! hara!\
harom hara!" and stir!\
Another world,\
another world,\
abounds the whole Earth!\
Go forth!\
Go shoving!\
Raise roar like stormwind!\
Transmit at the speed of thought!\
Like cataclysmic thunder of rainclouds\
పెళ పెళ పెళ పెళ break lose and descend!\
Go,\
go,\
go forth!\
Do you not see the other world's\
Radiant burning sacred flame?

Rising, rising, rising, they fall\
eight million mountains!\
Churning, churning, churning, the seas\
they dance a catastrophic deluge!\
Sizzling boiling grease? Not so\
A lake of hot blood!\
Like Shivasamudram,\
like the Niagara\
run! Run forth!\
Go forth!\
Go shoving!\
The other world's brassen kettledrum\
endlessly it blares!

Like serpents,\
like wilddogs,\
like ధనంజయుడు carry on!\
Do you not see the other world's\
fire crown's ధగధహలు,\
నిగనిగలు of the red flag,\
భుగభుగలు of the ritual flames!
