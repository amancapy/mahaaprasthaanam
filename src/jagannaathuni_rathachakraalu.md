# The World-father's Chariot Wheels

O downtrodden!\
O fallen\
O sorrow-serpent bitten!\
Of lives charred,\
of no import,\
in Lord Misfortune's chariot wheels'\
spokes fallen and crushed\
O helpless!\
O lowly!\
Sans sustenance, sans shelter\
O birds! O vagabonds!\
పరిచ్యుతులు by the comfortable,\
despised by mankind,\
exilants from the collective--\
జితాసువులు,\
చ్యుతాశయులు,\
హృతాశ్రయులు,\
హతాశులై,\
Weep not weep not!\
Your blood seething and seething\
your hamlets roiling and roiling\
your innards burning and burning\
weep not weep not!\
ఓ వ్యథా నిమిష్టులార!\
ఓ కథా వశిష్టులార!\
O downtrodden!\
O fallen\
O sorrow-serpent bitten!\
Weep not weep not!

They're coming they're coming...\
The World-father's,\
The World-father's,\
The World-father's chariot wheels!\
The World-father's chariot wheels!\
Chariot wheels,\
chariot wheels,\
chariot wheels, chariot wheels,\
they're coming they're coming!

O downtrodden!\
O fallen\
In the sky-path* మొయిళారి\
those embarked\
chariot wheels, chariot wheels,\
they're coming they're coming!

The Simhaachalam has shifted,\
the Himaalayam has melted,\
the Vindhya-mountain has shattered--\
Lion-mountain,\
Snow-mountain,\
Vindhya-mountain, Dusk-mountain*...\
The great moutains are afloat!\
The great chariot is moving!\
చూర్ణమాన\
ఘూర్ణమాన\
దీర్ణమాన mountain-summits\
గిర గిర గిర they're turning!\
O downtrodden!\
O fallen\
O sorrow-serpent bitten!\
Come along! Come! Come!

At the edge of town, dried out\
lake and by it, tree-shade--\
with gunny bags, with pots,\
look whichever way there darkness,\
there suffering, great despair--\
prisons, nooses,\
suicide in the canal!\
O my swindled little brothers!\
Your miseries I do know...\
In trouble, great\
In distress, immense\
In the cold తెగనవసి smoulder your miseries, your tales\
to my understanding they do come\
O downtrodden!\
O fallen\
O my swindled little brothers!

For your sake, the pen grasped,\
off along the sky's paths\
going in a great hurry\
the World-father's chariot wheels,\
the chariot wheels' cataclysmic roar\
down the Earthwards-path I shall set!\
Earthquake shall I beget!

The heavy-braided dancer's\
forehead-eye has splintered they say!\
Forehead-flame burns they say!\
Forehead-flame!\
Forehead-fire!\
Forehead-eye with havoc\
the world it frightens!\
అరె ఝూఁ! ఝూఁ!\
ఝటక్, ఫటక్...\
హింసనచణ\
destruction-writing\
ధ్వంసనచణ\
Torment-writing!\
Poison-air, wooden-cannon,\
torpedo, tornado!\
That is catastrophy,\
that is war,\
this way or that will it hew?\
Wrath,\
crisis,\
skirmish, affray!\
హాలాహలం smoke darkens!\
Uproar rages!\
O downtrodden!\
O fallen!\
This is sacrifice* సవనం,\
this is war!\
This flying iron hawk,\
this sprouted fire-harvest--\
scattering away traitors,\
wiping away flaws,\
Self-rule,\
egality,\
amicability\
as foundations houses so raised,\
to the collective good fortune పూచి--\
peace, peace, peace, peace\
the whole world it will win,\
this dream will come true!\
This heaven will prove true!\
O downtrodden!\
O fallen\
O sorrow-serpent bitten!\
O my swindled little brothers!\
Weep not weep not!

They've come, they've arrived,\
the World-father's,\
the World-father's,\
the World-father's chariot wheels,\
the World-father's chariot wheels,\
chariot wheels,\
chariot wheels,\
chariot wheels, chariot wheels,\
come along! come! come!\
This world is yours indeed!\
This kingdown you shall rule!
