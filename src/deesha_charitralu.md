# The Histories of Nations

Whatever nation's history you look at\
what cause is there for pride?\
The entirety of mankind's history\
a refuge to the torment of the other.

The entirety of mankind's history\
an undertaking of reciprocated slaughter;\
The entirety of mankind's history\
drenched in war-blood flow.

భీబత్సరస ప్రధానం\
పిశాచగణ సమవాకారం!\
The entirety of mankind's history\
the roasting and eating of the impoverished.

The strong the race of the weak\
into slaves have turned;\
Murderers of men turned rulers of the Earth\
to fame in history have risen.

Land that is not battleground\
search the whole Earth but you will not find;\
All past is doused in blood,\
if not then in tears.

Households ran cold,\
the multitude of people dead,\
the terror-cries of the helpless,\
in history these groan.

Inequality, greed,\
crookery, envies, స్పర్థలు\
with tricks and pseudonyms\
history's fate these have determined.

Genghis Kahn, తామర్లేనూ,\
Nadir Shah, Ghazni, Ghori,\
or be it Alexendar, what does it matter who?\
Each one a great slaughterer.

The Vikings, the శ్వేతహూణులు,\
the Scythians, the Persians,\
పిండారులు, థగ్గులు have built\
a bridge of swords to time.

In టంధయుగం of ignorance,\
in hunger, in excitement--\
by unknown great forces\
driven, humans--

that all is their ingenuity,\
that they alone are lords of the Earth,\
empires so founded,\
contrived laws so constructed

when other forces awoke\
fell like houses of cards!\
In reciprocal skirmishes\
of forces was history born.

A timeless deceit,\
the inhumanities of the strong,\
the plottings of the wealthy,\
Further still?! No longer will they sustain.

A person another person,\
A race another race,\
the collective's custom of tormenting\
Further still? No longer will it persist.

A rickshawman in China,\
A Czech mine-worker,\
In Ireland a boat-driver,\
all అణగారిన sufferers--

the Hottentot, the Jews, The Negros,\
countless races the continents across\
the true essence of history\
they proclaim in one voice.

Which war was fought for what cause?\
Which kingdom lasted for how long?\
The dates, the receipts\
not these, man, are history's meaning.

The love-tale of this queen,\
the expenditures on that besiegement,\
topics, discussions,\
not these, man, are history's essence.

In history's dark corner,\
fallen to the depths, unseen,\
all of these tales we now need!\
Truth that evades concealing.

In the Nile-valley civilization,\
of what sort was the commonman's life?\
To construct the Taj Mahal,\
who were the laborers who lifted the stones?

In the imperial crusade\
of what sort was the courage of the commonfolk?\
Not the lord's palanquin, man,\
who were the bearers of it?

Takshashila, Pataliputra,\
the shore of the Mediterranean Sea,\
Harappa, Mohenjo-daro,\
in the cave-murals of the Cro-Magnon--

in the dawn-twilights of history\
of what sort is the human story's blooming?\
What nation in what age,\
what great object did it achieve?

What sculpture? What literature?\
What science? What song?\
To what lights, this journey?\
Which dawn? Which great victory?
