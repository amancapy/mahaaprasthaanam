<p>At the behest of "vishaalaandhra Publications" publishing from London, in the process of tape-recording my "mahaaprasthaanam" poems[1], and along with the casettes with my voice, releasing all of these poems in my own handwriting in fascimile form, my friend Dr. G. Krishnamurti in the role of publisher asked me to say something as foreword. I thought then that I should read Chalam's yoogyataapatram[2] straight. My friends insisted that my own opinions should be heard. "Fine" I answered.</p>
<p>I did not feel that the missing of Chalam's writing from this publication was a flaw. Surely it has its own eminent merit wherever it may exist. It happens that there are some who hold that it alone is prominent. In the "praja" (questions; answers[3]) section that I had conducted in the weekly "pragati," an M.A. student by the name piccireDDi asked, "I contend that one does not need to read mahaaprasthaanam, should they have read yoogyataapatram. What would you say?" My reply was "You are one with a fitting title"[4]!</p>
<p>jalasuutram rukmiNiinaathashaastri was the one to diligently get words of praise written by Chalam's hand. ఆ రోజుల్లో రుక్కాయి నాకు, in his own words, he worked as an "unofficial publicity officer." He would note down in a notebook where my poems were published. A large chunk he knew by heart. Once, visiting my place, he saw the then-incomplete "jagannaathuni rathachakraalu"[5]. Only this one, among all the poems in mahaaprasthaanam, was not written at a stretch. Even the particularly lengthy poems like "kavitaa, oo kavitaa!"[6] I had written in single stretches. As a parody to "vastunnaayostunnaay"[7], saying "veLipooyaay veLipooyaay"[8] జరుక్కు he wrote "aashvaasaantam" and got it printed in "bhaarati." So hastened, I completed "rathachakraalu." It was published the following month in "bhaarati."</p>
<p>I readied the press-copy for mahaaprasthaanam back in the 1940s. As soon as I heard of janaardanaraavu's death, I resolved that this book was to be dedicated to him. That very day (sometime in 1938) I readied the tribute-poem "talavanchuku veLipooyaavaa! neestam"[9]. This manuscript would not be published until much later, in 1950. The first publication saw light of day with the financial support of my friend "naLinii kumaar." James Joyce's Ulysses too was published in his fortieth year in Paris.</p>
<p>Following that, mahaaprasthaanam has been published more or less twenty times through vishaalaandhra Publications. Therefore I doubted the merit in making this new London publication. shrii puripanDaa had this to give as reason: "mahaaprasthaanam is this century's sole great work of poetry[10] in Telugu." He said this too: "As far as I know, in no other Indian language either has come to be a poem as great as 'kavitaa! oo kavitaa!" There's another important reason for this publication as well. This is my own handwriting. My own voice. A new practice wholly unheard of in poetry in any language, in any period!</p>
<p>One time, gooraashaastri said to me, "Srisri! Say what you will. But this is my opinion! I am a greater writer than anyone in India today." "My contention is the same!" I replied.</p>
<p>I wrote all the "mahaaprasthaanam" poems in the 30s. (I wrote "nijangaanee", "garjinchu raShyaa!" in 41, "niiDalu" in 47)[11] The decade between 30 and 40, historians call the Hungry Thirties. The economic recession that had just begun in America spread across the whole world. (save solely for the egalitarian* సామ్యవాద Russia.) It was in that decade that the Spanish Civil War waged as rehearsal to the Second World War. It was in that period that ఆడెన్, స్పెండర్, డేలూయిస్, డిలాన్ థామస్, తార్జి బార్కర్ etc. had made great writings. It was then that the Indian Progressive Writers' Manifesto was published from England. Amidst all of these surges flowed my mahaaprasthaanam poems too.</p>
<p>Though I was responding to all of these realities, I did not know at the time that such writing was called "societal realism,"* సామాజిక వాస్తవికత or that behind it as support was the guidance called Marxism. If one look backs now, it is quite clear that the Marxist inspiration, and social consciousness were not యాదృచ్చికాలు.</p>
<p>One thing is certain. In 1933's "neenusaitam prapanchaagniki..."[12] for the final time I bid adieu to classicistic style and fixed meters[13]. These indeed are gurajaaDa's[14] footsteps. gurajaaDa gave to Telugu poetry a new turn from the path of the classical cart that had carried on unimpeded, crumbling, for a thousand years. He redirected Telugu poetry from the paths trodden by chariots, palanquins, horsecarts to the modern age frequented by motors and trains. This path that gurajaaDa had shown I rewidened with mahaaprasthaanam poems.</p>
<p>This pertains to technique. The verses written in classicism are like chariots. Like palanquins. gurajaaDa instructed to write in conversational language. He instructed to use మాత్రా చ్ఛందస్సులు. Therefore, I've made my attempt* ఉద్యమించు with excitement, with agitation. Now to come to the point, I trusted that moreso than in beautiful lies, in harsh truth could poetry be made seen. With this had undergone the holding up of the mirror to societal truths in mahaaprasthaanam poems.</p>
<p>The next step to this is egalitarianist reality* సామ్యవాద వాస్తవికత. This we have not yet grasped. Capitalist jackals, to prevent its grasping, are designing great intrigues. Classicism stands in assitance to these.</p>
<p>Herbert Read had said of classicism,: "Classicism, let it be said without further preface, represents for us now, and has always represented, the forces of oppression. Classicism is the intellectual counterpart of political tyranny. It was so in the ancient world and in the medieval empires; it was renewed to express the dictatorships of the him [sic] Renaissance and has ever been the official creed of Capitalism.”</p>
<p>Along with classicism, nationalistic hubris too has been preventative of అభ్యుదయము. International దృక్పథము alone is antidote to this. This essence of internationality indeed had I invited in saying "chiinaaloo rikShaavaalaa, cek deeshapu gani panimaniShi."[15] There isn't really anything unbefitting of those of poor countries to think 'my house, my country.' But for such sentiments to reach a head and వెర్రితలలు వేయు is dangerous. Then with thinking 'my house, my country' do occur the laying waste to the next house over, the pillaging of other countries. I hold that good poetry has no greater duty than to, with this keen internationalistic lens, flay and banish this plunder.</p>
<p>All that I've down in "mahaaprasthaanam" is to deliberate over societal రుగ్గత. "This is our world! Such are the people here!" I've said. This is an apt study of disease, but one must not stop here. One must look for a cure to the disease. These diseases do not relent to superficial balmings. What is imperative is surgery. That I call "revolution."</p>
<p>There are progressive* అభ్యుదయ poetry and the seeds of revolution in mahaaprasthaanam. But not revolutionary writing. What is "revolutionary writing"? That which makes the commonfolk the inheritors* కుద్యుక్తులు to the practice of revolution!</p>
<p>This is my word. Now making my thanks to Krishnamurti, my London publisher,<br />
I shall be.</p>
